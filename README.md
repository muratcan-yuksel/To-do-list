<h2>A web developer classic: To-do List</h2>
<ul>
<li>The tricky part was to create different projects which hold different to-dos  </li>
<li> I flexed my webpack muscles in this project, and added an external package, date-fns to manipulate the dates in a more readable way </li>
<li> I also tried to focus on OOP principles. Still have troubles dividing the DOM from the application logic tho' </li>
<h2>What can the user do?</h2>
<p>The user </p>
<li>can add and delete to-dos </li>
<li>can add and delete different projects and add different to-dos in them </li>
<li> can specify the due date and the priority of to-dos </li>
<li>can see the details of a specific to-do on hover (tooltip) </li>
<p>The live preview of the application can be found <a href ="https://muratcan-yuksel.github.io/To-do-list/">here</a> </p>
